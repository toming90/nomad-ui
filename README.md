An awesome user interface for an awesome scheduler, plain and simple :-)

# Usage

Download the latest release from the Github repository and start it with:

```
./nomad-ui-<os>-<arch>
```

This will start the nomad-ui server that will try to connect to local
nomad server. The frontend can be accessed on port `3000` by default.
You can override this with the `-web.listen-address`.

Another way to run nomad-ui is through Docker. Run the following command to
start a webserver that will serve the application.

```
docker run -e NOMAD_ADDR=... -p 8000:3000 iverberk/nomad-ui:v0.3.1
```

Check the releases page on Github to see which version is current.

The user interface will be accessible on localhost, port `8000`. Adjust the Docker
run parameters as needed. If you need to change the port that Nomad is listening
on, you should do it with ```-e NOMAD_ADDR``` environment variable that contains
both hostname and port.

`NOMAD_ADDR` (IP or DNS name) should point to the correct location of your Nomad server.
If you have a Node and Go environment you can also build the production version yourself.

# Try

You need a running nomad server to try nomad ui:

```
nomad agent -server -client -bootstrap-expect 1 -data-dir /tmp/nomad
```

Now you can run nomad ui in other terminal (we assume you have it in PATH):

```
nomad-ui-<os>-<arch>
```

Open browser and visit [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

## Build

Project is built using make:

```
make
```

The resulting files will be stored in `build/` folder:

```
build/webpack              - frontend webapp that can be served by any webserver
build/nomad-ui-<os>-<arch> - nomad-ui binary containing both the backend server and frontend webapp
```

By default it builds binary for host system. You can cross-compile and
build binaries for different systems and architectures as well:

```
GOBUILD='linux-amd64 windows-386 <GOOS>-<GOARCH>' make
```

See [docs](https://golang.org/doc/install/source) for the whole list of available `GOOS` and `GOARCH`
values.

# Development

Just run ```npm install``` and ```npm start``` and start developing. Hot reloading is enabled, so any
changes will be visible in the browser immediately. Unfortunately there are no tests yet.
